					<h3 class ="abilities">The questions in a paper may be designed to test the following abilities:</h3>
					<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right hand">  Recall</span>   These are based on facts, principles, formulae or laws of the discipline of the paper. The candidate is expected to be able to obtain the answer either from his/her memory of the subject or at most from a one-line computation</p>
					<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right hand">  Comprehension</span>   These questions will test the candidateâ€™s understanding of the basics of his/her field, by requiring him/her to draw simple conclusions from fundamental ideas.</p>
					<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right hand">  Application</span>    In these questions, the candidate is expected to apply his/her knowledge either through computation or by logical reasoning.</p>
					<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right hand"> Analysis and Synthesis</span>In these questions, the candidate is presented with data, diagrams, images etc. that require analysis before a question can be answered. A Synthesis question might require the candidate to compare two or more pieces of information. Questions in this category could, for example, involve candidates in recognising unstated assumptions, or separating useful information from irrelevant information.</p>
