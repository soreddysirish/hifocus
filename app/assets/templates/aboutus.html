				<h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
				<p>Codingmart was created by a bunch of people who have always challenged status quo and wanted to combine forces to make positive impact on the lives of entrepreneurs and consumers alike, through the products that we build. We care more about bringing innovation to the products that we build than attending networking events to hand our business cards out to random people. And, hence we only accept projects that we ourselves truly believe in.</p>
